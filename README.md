# Motivation

Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) that pose a risk of injuring people must be equipped with functional safety systems. Functional safety aims to eliminate unacceptable risks of physical harm.
In industrial indoor environments, AMRs are typically equipped with safety-certified sensitive bumpers, ultrasonic sensors, or more commonly, two 2D LiDAR laser scanners.
However, these sensors share a common limitation: they cannot classify objects. As a result, 2D laser scanners are frequently triggered by environmental factors such as rain, dust, snowflakes, branches, and leaves in outdoor applications.
These false positives lead to unnecessary stops and reduced productivity of the AMR. Moreover, laser scanners cannot distinguish between a person lying on the ground and traversable objects like curbs.
To address these challenges, it is essential to implement object classification and localisation methods that perform reliably under all weather and lighting conditions in diverse environments.

Regardless of the sensing modality, each sensor or detector combination has limitations. For example:

- RGB cameras fail in low-light conditions or when exposed to direct sunlight.
- Thermal cameras struggle in hot environments where the temperature gradient between a person and the background is minimal.
- Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras can be blinded by sunlight and distorted by snowflakes.
- Radar sensors have difficulty localising multiple objects simultaneously and may miss low-reflectance targets like humans in the presence of nearby metal objects.
- Ultrasonic sensors offer low information density and short range, leading to undetected objects.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-modal sensor fusion approach. By combining different sensing modalities,
we aim to eliminate common-cause failures and enhance the robustness of object detection and classification in diverse environments.

# Goal

Our greater goal is to achieve safe AMRs in outdoor applications, more flexible safety in industrial human-robot collaborations and reduced overall cost.
We therefore want to compare object classification and localisation methods in the different modalities.
We want to evaluate the safety and productivity of each modality, depending on the domain (industrial indoor or European urban outdoor), weather and lighting conditions.

# Robot Platform EFEU

The efeuCampus Bruchsal GmbH, established in 2018 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the city of Bruchsal, aims to revolutionize urban logistics through innovative, eco-friendly solutions.
The abbreviation **EFEU** stands for **E**co-**F**riendly **E**xperimental **U**rban logistics.
The project focuses on reducing the environmental impact of urban logistics by using AMRs for the delivery of parcels and for the collection and disposal of waste.
Each AMR can handle two containers that can be placed in transfer docks or opened by the user with their credentials over a web application.
Since the perception of the AMR is not safe yet, they have to be accompanied by a person with a wireless emergency stop.
One of the five AMRs carries a sensor bracket in place of one of the containers and is therefore limited to deliveries with one container.
The sensor bracket is described in the following.

# Sensor Position and Rosbags

The sensor bracket consists of a ToF camera, a RGB camera, a thermal camera, a radar array, a temperature sensor and a control cabinet. The two 2D laser scanners are integrated in the body of the AMR, as well as the ultrasonic sensor array.
The control cabinet contains an _Intel UP Xtreme_ PC, a switch, and power supplies for 5V, 12V, 24V and 230V AC.

Besides the technical drawing, all sensor positions and the model of the AMR are saved in `/urdf_viewer`.

## Rosbags

To view the AMR with the sensors, their coordinate systems, and the data, the Rosbags for ROS1 and ROS2 can be played. You can find a ROS1 and ROS2 package called urdf_viewer in the following directory:

- [ros1](./dataset_rosbag_viewer/ros1/urdf_viewer/README.md)
- [ros2](./dataset_rosbag_viewer/ros2/urdf_viewer/README.md)

# Sensors and Calibration

## Ultrasonic Array

Four automotive ultrasonic sensors are mounted equally spaced at the front of the AMR and are tilted upwards.
All information about the four ultrasonic sensors can be found in:  
[Ultrasonic sensor array](./sensors/Ultrasonic.md)

## 2D Laser Scanner

Two Sick Microscan 3 laser scanners are mounted on two diagonal opposed corners to have a 360Â° view of the scene without any blind spots.
All information about the two laser scanners can be found in:
[2D Laser scanner](./sensors/Laserscan.md)

## ToF Camera

The ESPROS TOFcam660 is a 3D ToF camera the offers a dense 3D point cloud, depth images, and active NIR illuminated 2D images of the scenes.
All information about the ToF camera can be found in:
[ToF camera](./sensors/ToF.md)

## RGB Camera

The industrial RGB camera from Baumer is equipped with a global shutter and and a 2/3" CMOS sensor and is capable of recording scenes in very low light conditions.
All information about the RGB camera can be found in:
[RGB camera](./sensors/RGB.md)

## Thermal Camera

The Flir Boson 640 is a high resolution thermal camera without cooling. With high dynamic range, even small temperature gradients are visible.
All information about the thermal camera can be found in:
[Thermal camera](./sensors/Thermal.md)

## Radar Sensor

The MIMO radar sensor AWR1843AOP from Texas Instruments has 3 TX antennas and 4 RX antennas. It is therefore capable of recording 4D scenes with Azimuth, Elevation, Range and Doppler.
All information about the radar sensor can be found in:
[Radar sensor](./sensors/Radar.md)

# Meta Data

The metadata is saved as a `.txt` for each frame with the following information:

- Season: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter
- Weather: Sunny, Cloudy, Overcast, Foggy, Rain, Snow
- Daytime: Day, Dawn, Night
- Name of Rosbag with date and time

Additionally, the air temperature is saved in Â°C in the /08_ultrasonic/pub_1/ `.json` `"temperature": ` message of the ultrasonic sensor to compensate for the temperature dependent speed of sound.

# Recording and Synchronisation

All scenes were recorded with ROS 1 rosbags. The bags are extracted and a data cluster with all modalities is saved, if their timestamps do not differ by more than 40 ms.
The ToF has an offset of the timestamp, due to its long internal processing.
The synchronising was validated by rotating heated resistors, that were visible in all modalities, except ultrasonic.
The ultrasonic sensors were synchronised by approaching a wall with the reference distance from the ToF camera and laser scanners.

![Time synchronization of the ros messages](./images/Synchronization.png) <br>
Time synchronization of the ros messages of the different modalities. The dashed blue frame shows a time slot of 40ms where all sensors have at least published one message.
If a sensors has several messages in the time frame, the message closest to the center of the time frame is chosen.

# Labels

The dataset contains the following labels:

- 0 person
- 1 bicycle
- 2 slidecar
- 3 doll
- 4 curb (Only in 3D)
- 5 vegetation (Only in 3D)

## 3D

The 3D point clouds are manually labeled in CVAT [4] using the KITTI format. The rotation of the bounding boxes is adjusted to create the smallest possible 3D box that fully encloses the object.
However, the vertical rotation does not necessarily indicate the direction of walking or driving.  
â  Caution! The 3D labels are in the KITTI format [2], but with inverted x-axis due to left-handed coordinate system of the ToF camera before preprocessing. â   
These KITTI labels with the left-hand coordinate system will be called _SEW KITTI_ for the following.  
KITTI labels explained: https://towardsdatascience.com/kitti-coordinate-transformations-125094cd42fb/  
The labels are aligned with the 3D point clouds of the ToF camera and can be projected in the rgb and thermal images, as well as in the radar frames, ultrasonic data and the laser scans.

## 2D RGB

The 3D labels, that were manually labeled in CVAT, are projected with their wire frame into the RGB images. A 2D bounding box that fully encloses the projected wire frame is used as a label proposition.
The proposed labels are in the YOLO [3] format and are then manually aligned with the calibrated RGB images.

## 2D RGB labels with distance

The 2D labels with distance are in the YOLO [3] format, but with the distance as another parameter in the last position of the label.
The distance is the Cartesian distance (z+) in meters to the closest point of the object, measured by the ToF camera and 2D laser scanners.
The labels are otherwise identical to the 2D YOLO labels and aligned with the calibrated rgb images.

## 2D thermal and 2D thermal with distance

The calibrated RGB and thermal images are overlaid to align perfectly at a distance of 1.5â¯m.
Due to the side-by-side installation of the two cameras, horizontal misalignment increases at distances shorter or greater than 1.5â¯m and is physically unavoidable.
To generate the thermal labels, the center of the RGB labels is shifted depending on the object's distance to align with the thermal objects.

The correction is applied as follows:  
`x_center_thermal = x_center_rgb - 0.03125 + (0.03125 / distance)`.  
The `y_center, width, and height` remain unchanged.  
The thermal labels with distance use the same distance values as the RGB labels with distance.

When an object is oriented such that the z-distance (depth) varies significantly between the points defining the left and right edges of its bounding box,
the object is shifted based on the point closest to the camera.
Consequently, the farther edge becomes misaligned, as its greater distance is not accounted for in the shift computation.
This depth-induced misalignment is particularly pronounced for elongated objects, such as bicycles, when they are positioned at short distances from the camera.

# Discussion

## Representative

For a representative dataset to validate the AMR for a productive real work environment, it would be best if the robot had gathered the dataset on normal routes with normal pedestrians.
However, our campus is not crowded and most pedestrians avoid the AMR, not interfering with its path. Therefore, many hours of normal driving operation result in almost no protective field violation for training and validation.
Since the AMR needs permission for public environments and persons that are recorded close up have to sign a privacy policy, it was not possible to choose crowded city centres or similar environments to record the dataset.
We therefore deliberately expose the AMR to as many edge cases as possible

The doll should represent a child, but the body proportions do not match those of a child. Furthermore, the doll has no heat signature. It has proven infeasible to heat the doll evenly for long scenes.
Therefore, no individuals under the age of 18 are included, and the doll is labeled as a doll rather than a person.

## Label alignment

The outlines of the 3D bounding boxes do not project perfectly into the 2D image space of the RGB and thermal cameras, so we manually aligned all the 2D labels for the RGB camera.
Since a beam splitter for thermal and RGB cameras is expensive, requires more space, and needs manual adjustment, there is a low chance it will be used in commercially available outdoor AMRs.
We therefore accept poorer performance of RGB and thermal fusion in order to keep the setup simple.
While the distance-dependent misalignment of the RGB labels in the thermal images decreases the detection performance in a deep fusion branch, it enables the network to better estimate the distance to objects.

## Labelled curbs and vegetation

Radar and ultrasonic object detectors distinguish better between curbs and lying persons than between lying persons and background (no label).
Therefore, we added them to the 3D labels.
Since missing a curb does not pose a safety risk, they are not considered for our evaluation and leaderboard.
